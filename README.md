# Personal Website Project

## Overview
This is my personal website project, a portfolio and creative space I designed and coded from scratch. It’s meant to showcase who I am, my experiences, and my interests in a way that feels authentic and personal, while practicing my front-end skills.

## Website Sections
- **Home Page:** Introduces me and what inspired me to start coding.  
- **Portfolio Page:** Highlights my coding projects and experiences, including my website itself.  
- **Reading Corner:** Shares my book recommendations and includes a BuzzFeed-style quiz that helps users find their perfect genre match.  
- **STEM 4 ALL Page:** Offers resources for high school students — scholarships, internships, and educational programs — to make opportunities in tech more accessible.

## Features
- Navigation bar included on all pages for smooth browsing.  
- Accessible design with alt text for all images.  
- Custom CSS styling with fonts, colors, and layout inspired by a bookish, warm aesthetic.  
- Interactive quiz built using JavaScript.  
- Responsive layout that works across different screen sizes.
